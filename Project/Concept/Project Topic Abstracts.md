# PhysComp SS23 Group 09 - Project Topic Abstracts

## Preference 1

### The physics of time

For this topic, we propose a timer that forces the students to respond to it, e.g. for finishing a presentation in time. This device can also be used as an alarm clock. On the physical side, the device has some way of notifying that the time is almost up. There should be at least a speaker or buzzer for making a noise. Additionally, one or multiple LEDs could visually indicate the remaining time. Also, the device should have the form of a smartphone holder. In order to force the user to respond to it, the smartphone gets ejected via a motor-controlled spring mechanism when the time is up. This way, students are forced to finish their presentations or get out of bed in time, because they have to catch their smartphone. For convenience, the timer should automatically activate when the smartphone gets placed in the holder. On the computing side, the operation mode (timer or alarm clock) as well as the time can comfortably be set via a smartphone (web app).

There are probably not many people interested in having their smartphone taken hostage and risking to damage it. However, this project can function as a piece of art, highlighting people's dependence on their smartphone. Also, the general concept can be applied to less fragile objects. For example, by launching a ball every hour. If the ball is aimed away from you, you would have to get up from your desk, resulting in a healthy break.

This project fulfills all requirements: It has interaction in both ways, is multimodal, has a physical and computational side and displays the remaining time.

A simple protoype can be created from a few pieces of wood and a spring. There are only a few electronical components required:
* A computer featuring GPIO and WiFi, e.g. the Raspberry Pi
* A motor
* A buzzer/speaker
* A breadboard
* Jumper wires
* LEDs
* Resistors
* Transistors or optocouplers

## Preference 2

Telepresence, mouse, whatever

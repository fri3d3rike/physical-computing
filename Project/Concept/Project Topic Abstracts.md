# PhysComp SS23 Group 09 - Project Topic Abstracts

## Preference 1

The physics of time

* An alarm clock that can also be used as a timer for presentations
* It features physical buttons or dials for setting the time
* It features a smartphone holder
* Putting a smartphone into the holder activates the alarm clock or timer (depending on the desired use case)
* When the time is up, a spring mechanism ejects the smartphone
* This way, the user is motivated to get out of bed or finish their presentation because they have to catch their smartphone
* Otherwise, the smartphne might take damage when it hits the floor
* There are probably not many people interested in actually using such an alarm clock
* But it can function as a piece of art, highlighting people's dependence on their smartphone
* If our prototype works, the concept can be applied to less fragile objects
* For example, to motivate people to get up every hour when sitting on a desk by throwing something for them to catch
* The remaining time should be displayed in some way
* An alarm should indicate that the object is about to be launched
* There are obviously physical and computing components
* The project can be realized with a GPIO-enabled microcontroller, a motor, a spring and small amounts of wood
* If the time is not set via an app, there need to be dials
* The set/remaining time is shown via LEDs
* A buzzer indicates that the time is almost up
* Smalll electronical components: Resistors, transistors, jumper wires, breadboard

Write a paper-style abstract of a topic. Include details on what **scenario** your prototype would be used in, who the **users** are, and how the **project requirements** (specified in the Topics slides) will be fulfilled. Also think about how the project could be realized as a prototype.

## Preference 2

Telepresence, mouse, whatever

## Preference 1

### The physics of time

For this topic, we propose a timer that forces students to respond to it, e.g. for finishing a presentation in time. This device can also be used as an alarm clock. On the physical side, the device has some way of notifying that the time is almost up. There should be at least a speaker or buzzer for making a noise. Additionally, one or multiple LEDs could visually indicate the remaining time. Also, the device should have the form of a smartphone holder. In order to force the user to respond to it, the smartphone gets ejected via a motor-controlled spring mechanism when the time is up. This way, students are forced to finish their presentations or get out of bed in time, because they have to catch their smartphone. For convenience, the timer should automatically activate when the smartphone gets placed in the holder. On the computing side, the operation mode (timer or alarm clock) as well as the time can comfortably be set via a smartphone (web app).

There are probably not many people interested in having their smartphone taken hostage and risking to damage it. However, this project can function as a piece of art, highlighting people's dependence on their smartphone. Also, the general concept can be applied to less fragile objects. For example, by launching a ball every hour. If the ball is aimed away from you, you would have to get up from your desk, resulting in a healthy break.

This project fulfills all requirements: It has interaction in both ways, is multimodal, has a physical and computational side and displays the remaining time.

A simple protoype can be created from a few pieces of wood and a spring. There are only a few electronical components required: A computer featuring GPIO and WiFi, e.g. the Raspberry Pi, a motor, a buzzer/speaker, a breadboard, jumper wires, LEDs, resistors and transistors or optocouplers.

## Preference 2

### Telepresence system

The target group for the telepresence device is professionals who attend hybrid meetings, where some participants are physically present in the meeting room, and others participate remotely. The device is particularly useful for remote participants who need to actively engage in the meeting but cannot be physically present.
The device should be able to rotate automatically look at interesting regions, such as following a person's face. It should also be able to hold a tablet or phone securely in place and be easily adjustable for different devices. Additionally, it should have features such as audio and video capabilities.
It should be easy to set up and use and adaptable to different meeting spaces.
The device should be compact, easy to operate, and adaptable. It should be able to hold various sizes of tablets or phones securely in place
and should be able to rotate automatically to follow the user's movements without making too much noise. The device should be compatible with standard video conferencing software and should offer high-quality audio and video.
The device should be compact and easy to transport so that it fits on a table or desk and blends in with the meeting space.
The telepresence device would be used in hybrid meeting scenarios where some participants are physically present in a meeting room, and others join remotely. Remote participants could be located anywhere in the world and can connect to the meeting using standard video conferencing software. The device would enable remote participants to engage actively in the meeting and participate as if they were present in the meeting room.
Of course the device can also be used outside of the meeting room for any kind of videochat, personal use or similar activities.
The device would require a motorized base that can rotate to follow the remote user's movements. It would also require a tablet or phone holder that can be adjusted to hold various sizes of devices securely. The device would need to be powered by a (rechargeable) battery, and it should be controlled using a mobile app or a web-based interface. The audio and video quality would depend on the tablet or phone's camera and microphone.

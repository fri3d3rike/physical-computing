# Telepresence System Concept

## General Idea

* Remote controlled tablet/Smartphone holder on motorized wheels
* For video conferences where where camera movement/panning is required, e.g. if there are multiple participants in one room or if a single participant is moving around
* Operated by an other participant who is not present
* Automated following of the face of a person who is currently in the frame (none if multiple faces are in the frame)

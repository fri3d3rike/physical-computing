# PhysComp SS23 Group 09 - Week 05

## Progress Report

### What we achieved this week

![OmniBase](Figures/omniBase.jpg){width=40%}  


We created another paper prototype. This time we used the Omni Wheel Base from class as the main component and built the smartphone holder construction on top of it. That didn't change a lot about the concept but mainly the look of our device. Our new prototype also includes the 3 buttons we decided to add. They show the current mode with a small LED light inside the button.

We thought about where to position the buttons.  

**Option 1**:  on the front, below the tablet/smartphone.

**Option 2**:  somewhere on the side, not directly visible when looking at the front/ tablet.

We decided to go with Option 1 because the user then can always immediately see which mode is active due to the light inside the button. And its easier to locate the buttons because they are in direct field of view.

We prepared our concept for the presentations infront of the class this week.  
 

### What we could not achieve this week

The buttons are only indicated and not yet really pressable in the prototype.

### What we plan to do for the coming week

Order the missing components and start building the real prototype.


### Component List

#### To order
* Power adapter to run the Raspberry Pi on batteries (link tba)
* Three Push-buttons (ideally with integrated white LEDs) (link tba)
* A suitable switch that requires little force so that it can act as the main power switch (link tba)

#### Available
* Raspberry Pi or Arduino if the RPi cannot be powered with batteries
* MicroSD card for the RPi
* Batteries (AA and 9V)
* Omni Wheel Platform
* Three red and three green LEDs
* Jumper wires
* Beadboard
* Resistors
* Small wood or plastic pieces for the case and tablet holder
* Maybe 3D-printed parts that fit and look better

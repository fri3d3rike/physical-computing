# PhysComp SS23 Group 09 - Week 03

## Progress Report

### What we achieved this week

#### First Concept

We brainstormed on the rough design and came up with a solution that should be feasible on the technical side. We then refined our idea to a more user friendly and convenient concept. We drew some first sketches on what the device could look like and then created storyboards with a short descriptions of the use cases explaining the functionality. We also wrote down the requirements.

#### Sketches

#### Requirements

- The target group is
    - device user: people participating in video conferences, in possesion of a smartphone or tablet
    - remote user: people participating in video conferences, in possesion of a laptop or desktop computer
- The device can hold a smartphone or a tablet and use its camera for the videocall
- The device has motors for the movement of the wheels and the device
- The device can be controlled by another person in the videocall with their keyboard using the up-, down-, right- and left- arrow keys
- The device uses (in the automatic mode) facetracking to follow the person on the screen 
- The device moves fast and precise enough
- The device is battery-powered

### What we could not achieve this week

Nothing. 

### What we plan to do for the coming week

We want to evaluate if our ideas are appropriate. We also want to work on the paper prototype, write a component list and think of milestones.

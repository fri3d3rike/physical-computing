# PhysComp SS23 Group 09 - Week 03

## Progress Report

### What we achieved this week

#### First Concept

We brainstormed on the rough design and came up with a solution that should be feasible on the technical side. We then refined our idea to a more user friendly and convenient concept. We drew some first sketches on what the device could look like and then created storyboards with a short descriptions of the use cases explaining the functionality. We also wrote down the requirements.

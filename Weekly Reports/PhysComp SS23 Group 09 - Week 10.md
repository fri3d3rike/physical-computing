## Evaluation Plan:

### Usability Test Plan: Telepresence Device for Hybrid Meetings

### Introduction:
The purpose of this usability test is to evaluate the functionality, ease of use, and overall user experience of the telepresence device designed for users attending hybrid meetings. The target group for this test is people who actively engage in remote meetings and need a seamless and immersive experience. The test will focus on assessing the device's rotation capabilities, tablet/phone holding mechanism, setup process, adaptability to different meeting spaces, and user interface.

### Test Objectives:

- Evaluate the ease of setup and use of the telepresence device.
- Assess the functionality of the device's ability to rotate and its ability to follow a person's face.
- Determine the effectiveness and security of the tablet/phone holder.
- Test the adaptability of the device to different meeting spaces.
- Evaluate the intuitiveness and user-friendliness of the web-based interface of the remote participant
- Gather feedback on overall user experience and identify areas for improvement.


### Number of Test Users:
To test the device we need at least pairs of two. So that one person can be with the physcial product while the other person interacts remotely (ideally from another room). If possible, it is preferable to have even multiple users interacting simultaneously during the test to simulate realistic meeting scenarios and assess any potential issues with concurrent usage. 


### Target Group: 
Users who regularly participate in hybrid meetings with their tablet/pc/smartphone etc. and requiring remote participation. The participants should have experience with remote collaboration tools and video conferencing software like Zoom, Teams, etc. .


### Test Tasks and Scenarios:

- Task 1: Device Setup:   
The user with the device is asked to unpack and set up the telepresence device on a table or desk. The user is provided with a tablet and asked to to turn on the decive, by placing the tablet in the holder.

While doing that we observe the user's experience during the setup process, noting any difficulties or confusion encountered. Do the two useres get to device to connect without problems?

- Task 2: User Interface
The useres are provided with a web-based interface for controlling and connecting the device.
Then both of the users are instructed to connect to the device using the interface.

We observe the user's interactions and note any challenges or areas of confusion.

- Task 3: Remote Control:
The remote user that is not present in the room with the device, is asked to rotate the device manually to look at different participants in the other room. 

We observe if the device successfully rotates to track the user's face and adjusts its position accordingly. Drawing attention to excessive noise, delays, or inaccurate tracking.

- Task 4: Rotating Functionality:  
We instruct the user with the device to move around in the room while the device is set to follow their movements.  

We observe if the device successfully rotates according to the users input and if the control via the keyboard was intuitive. 


### Test Procedure:

1. Introduction and Pre-Test Questions:

Providing an overview of the test objectives and procedures to the participants.
Collecting background information about the participants, including their experience with hybrid meetings and remote collaboration tools.

2. Demonstration:

We present a brief demonstration of the telepresence device's features and capabilities to familiarize participants with its functionality.

3. Test Execution:

We encourage the participants to think aloud, express their thoughts, and verbalize their experience as they use the device.
Assigning the tasks to the participant and taking notes on participants' interactions, difficulties and feedback.

4. Post-Test Questionnaire:

Post-test questionnaire to gather additional feedback and subjective impressions from the participants.
Participants can ask questions, share their overall impressions, and provide any additional comments.

\<Questionaire will be inserted soon \>

### What we hope to learn 

What are common issues, patterns, and areas of improvement. What could be specified more clearly? 

### What functionality can you test, what can you fake(Wizard of Oz)?


In addition, you should plan to complement it with one additional evaluation technique discussed in the lecture (voluntary, 1 bonus point): e.g.,

Surveys
Technical Benchmarking
â€¦

Describe your plan accordingly on GitLab.

## Evaluation Plan Refinement:
Refine your evaluation plan from last week based on the feedback you received. Remember that you have to evaluate your project next week!


## Milestone Review
Review your project plan: Briefly report on which milestones/tasks you have been able to meet, and which are overdue. Adapt your plan to match your current progress and (re)define milestones until the end of the project. Shortly report on your changes.

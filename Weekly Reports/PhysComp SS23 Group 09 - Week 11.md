We worked on Milestone 4. We soldered the buttons and connected them to the frontpanel.

We assembled all the inner parts and started programming.

In theory, the functions for moving in different directions are now ready, but we have not tested them.


### What we could not achieve this week

* Find people for the evaluation
* Milestone 4

### What we plan to do for the coming week

Finish milestone 4 and start with 5. 
* Test driving
* Add status LEDs below the device
* Mount Ultrasonic sensors and camera
* Add on/off switch
* Write logic for controlling LEDs and on/off switch
* Assemble the rest (front panel, powerbank, tablet holder)
* Create web-interface for movement control

Find people for the evaluation of our prototype and evaluate.


## Evaluation Plan Refinement:
Write down your full study procedure. This may include the following steps; greeting the participant and introducing yourselves, briefly describing your project and the purpose of your study, giving them the consent form to sign, introducing them to the task, letting them perform the task (while talking out loud) -- meanwhile you might be recording and taking notes, after all tasks you may interview them or ask them to complete a survey, and finally you should have a debriefing in which you thank them and give them an opportunity to ask questions.


## Milestone Review

No milestone is overdue. We would have liked more progress on milestone 4. We had to set the deadline quite late, but we need parts of the functionality for the evaluation. We will have to figure out how to handle this in the next session.

1. Concept complete (DONE)
- Features clearly described
- Parts, sizes etc. planned out
- Mandatory and optional goals

2. All parts prepared (received, cut, printed) (DONE)
- Cutting
- Printing
- Ordering

3. Electronic components tested (DONE)
- Componentes tested individually
- Certain features tested: LEDs, buttons, camera, motors

4. Prototype assembled - Deadline 19.07.2023 (WIP)
- GOAL: Prototype assembled, components connected and tested
- TODO: Test driving code (weight/torque considerations)
- TODO: Properly mount ultrasonic sensors and camera
- TODO: Install LEDs under the device
- TODO: Mount front panel
- TODO: Mount powerbank
- TODO: Install on/off switch
- TODO: Finish tablet holder

5. Prototype functional - Deadline 26.07.2023
- GOAL: Programming complete
- TODO: On/off switch shows an effect
- TODO: Mode selection works
- TODO: Status LEDs work
- TODO: Remote control works
- OPTIONAL: Face tracking and automatic rotation
- OPTIONAL: Edge detection

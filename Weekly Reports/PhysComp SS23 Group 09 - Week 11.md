In theory, the functions for moving in different directions are now ready, but we have not tested them.


### What we could not achieve this week

* Find people for the evaluation
* Milestone 4

### What we plan to do for the coming week

Finish milestone 4 and start with 5. 
* Add LEDs below the device
* Add Ultrasonic sensors and mount camera
* Add on/off switch
* Write logic for controlling LEDs
* Create web-interface for movement control

Find people for the evaluation of our prototype and evaluate.


## Evaluation Plan Refinement:
Write down your full study procedure. This may include the following steps; greeting the participant and introducing yourselves, briefly describing your project and the purpose of your study, giving them the consent form to sign, introducing them to the task, letting them perform the task (while talking out loud) -- meanwhile you might be recording and taking notes, after all tasks you may interview them or ask them to complete a survey, and finally you should have a debriefing in which you thank them and give them an opportunity to ask questions.


## Milestone Review
Review your project plan: Briefly report on which milestones/tasks you have been able to meet, and which are overdue. Adapt your plan to match your current progress and (re)define milestones until the end of the project. Shortly report on your changes.

Also: Include deadlines

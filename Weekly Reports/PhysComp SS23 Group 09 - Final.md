# Final Report

## What we achieved

We added a third ultrasonic sensor in the back. This way, there is no risk of driving off an edge when going backward. There is no ultrasonic sensor in the front because we found nowhere to put it, it would look stupid and it also is not really necessary since you can see where you are going when driving forward.

We also asked other students whether we should encase the ultrasonic sensors. The voted for yes with 2:1 votes. Our prototype now looks more polished:

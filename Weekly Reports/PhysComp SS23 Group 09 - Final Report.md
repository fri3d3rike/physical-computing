### Concluding report
To conclude your series of progress reports, please make a final post on Gitlab with the content outlined below.
As usually a lot of productive work happens in the very last week, this gives you the opportunity to highlight the updates and changes you made to your prototype for the demo.
Youâ€™re most welcome to just summarize/copy from your slides.

1. Briefly describe your final prototype (~2 lines, e.g., "Our prototype is xxx for yyy with zzz.").
Then remind us..

what works: list the main features or functionalities from your concept that you were able to realize

what plans changed: if relevant, shortly describe any major deviation from your main concept (plan B?)

what doesn't work: outline in keywords what functionality your prototype is missing

what could work if...: reflect upon how future iterations could improve your prototype or what you would have done differently in retrospective


2. In this post, include a video of your final prototype in action (e.g., the one from your slides). This is what will survive, even after your prototypes are take apart.

3. Ensure that all your source code, design files, etc. are in your GitLab repository. Please add a README.md file in the subfolder with your project code, listing libraries/tutorials/code sources that you used (including links). In particular, please point out files wherein the code was not implemented by you. Also, please describe how to build and run your code.

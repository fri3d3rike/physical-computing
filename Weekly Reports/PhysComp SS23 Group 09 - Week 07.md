# PhysComp SS23 Group 09 - Week 07.md

## 3D Printing

We modeled a cup with our initials in Autodesk Fusion. The STEP file is in our Concept folder.

We are planning on using 3D printing for our front panel and possibly other parts like the supports that connect the wheel platform with the top board.

## Progress Report

### Milestones

We came up with five milestones. Small changes are possible even after the concept has been completed.

1. Concept complete
- Features clearly described
- Parts, sizes etc. planned out
- Mandatory and optional goals

2. All parts prepared (received, cut, printed)
- Cutting
- Printing
- Ordering

3. Electronic components tested
- Componentes tested individually
- Certain features tested

4. Prototype assembled
- Prototype assembled, but not fully programmed

5. Prototype functional
- Programming complete
- Connection with tablet established
- Things that could not be implemented must be faked (edge detection, automatic connection)

## Concept changes

We thought about the placement of the ultrasonic sensors. They are now in our sketches.

### What we achieved this week

The ordered components have arrived. We created a milestone plan.

We also consulted the scientific engineering services for available transistors. We have to check if there are suitable parts for us.

### What we could not achieve this week

We have not fully finished the concept because Friederike could not attend the lecture.

### What we plan to do for the coming week

We will finish the concept and start preparing all parts.

# PhysComp SS23 Group 09 - Week 13

## Progress Report

### What we achieved this week

We implemented all of the missing hardware features and improved our software.

* Mounted the camera module, connected it to the Pi
* Added ultrasonic sensors, they are wired up and give measurements
* Added cardboard brackets that hold the tablet in place
* Changed the resistors for our red status LEDs from 220 Ohms to 120 Ohms to make them brighter
* Improved the web UI: swapped the buttons/keys for turning and straving

### What we could not achieve this week

We haven't added four ultrasonic sensor, only two.

### What we plan to do for the coming week

* Maybe add another two ultrasonic sensors, if we can find a way to mount them. Then all movement directions are safe.
* Maybe implement an easier way of simulating the webUI authentication and connection for the status LEDs
* Prepare and exercise our presentation

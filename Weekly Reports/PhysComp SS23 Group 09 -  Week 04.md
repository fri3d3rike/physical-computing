# PhysComp SS23 Group 09 - Week 04

## Progress Report

### What we achieved this week

We created a first paper prototype in class using cardboards, hot glue and plastic cups. (Considering our first sketch and idea of the device). The device can hold a tablet with its triangular form and move its viewing angle with the two wheeels. We did not include any buttons yet, because our initial sketch and idea didn't yet consider them really.  

#### First Physical Prototype

During the the process we had the idea of using 2 different colored LEDs to signal the user whether the device is currently connected. So we made some changes to the sketch and adapted the prototype a little.  

#### Updated Sketch

Initially, we considered incorporating a button or switch on the right side of our device to enable power on and off functionality. However, we eventually opted to design the device to automatically turn on once it is connected to a tablet or smartphone and turn of as soon as it is removed. Here is a small sketch:

Next we also thought about the multimodality of our device and how we can process more input. We came up with the idea to give the user the possibility to switch between 3 different modes:

These modis can be selected with the according button on the front bottom side of the device. And a white LED will signal the currently selected active mode.

### Norman's Design Priciples

1. Visibility:
The triangular form and the slightly tilted board on the front of the device make it easy to understand, that phone has to be placed here.
The buttons for the 3 modes are also well visble.

2. Feedback:  
The LEDs on the bottom give a feedback of the current connection status and also signal whether the device is powered on.

3. Constraints:  

4. Mapping: 
The buttons for the 3 different modes are all next to each other, well labled and at a reasonible position.  

5. Consistency:  
The green light for connection and red light for no connection are consistent to the general understanding of those two colors.

6. Affordance:

### What we could not achieve this week



### What we plan to do for the coming week

We want to have a look at the omni wheel construct from the class inventar. It might be a better solution for the wheel part of our device. And then update the sketches so they can be presented to the class.

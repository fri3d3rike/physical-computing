## Feedback Report

### Concept Presentation

_Briefly summarize the feedback and comments you received on your concept presentation. List the most critical points (aim for at least 3)._

- consider renaming the lables of the three front buttons on the device, because they might not be intuitive 
- is the placement of the tablet on the device final? maybe also consider the middle instead of the front for a better balance
- how is the body/ movement tracking implemented?

_Describe how you could address these (you’re welcome to discuss this hypothetically to achieve your vision, if you don’t plan to actually realizing it in your prototype)._

- we thought about different names:
    - off/ disabled/ still/ hold/ motionless/ pause/ freeze
    - manual/ remote
    - automatic/ track/ follow
- technical: disabled, auto, manual  
- descriptive: freeze, follow, remote

After talking to serveal other people we decided to go with: Freeze, Follow and Remote

Considering the placement of the tablet we want to stick to the initial idea with the tablet upfront, because it has a nicer effect with the button pannel.   

### Peer Evaluation

_Briefly report on how you evaluated your own prototype/concept/story board with your partner group. (Did you discuss the story board? Did you play out a scenario in Wizard of Oz-style?) What was your experience?_

We used the storyboards to explain the possible functions and applications of our device and mostly worked with the paper prototype to disscuss improvements. Therefore it was really usefull to already have the low fidelity prototype to take it and imagine the final product.  

_What main feedback did you get here?_

### Feedback  
1. Possibility to change the angle of the smartphone/ tablet  
2. Edge detection/ feedback that the device is close to falling down
3. Make the tablet more secured when it is inside the device 
4. What happens when there is more than one person in the field of seight during the _follow mode_
5. Using a counter weight for a better balance 
6. color of the buttons

_What group did you partner up with for the prototype evaluation? Very briefly describe their project concept and summarize the most critical feedback points you gave them._

![Other Group](Figures/feedbackOthers.jpg){width=40%}

We partnered up with group 7. Their project is the Aurora Analog Timer. It's a time management tool for presentations containing to components. Once it has the main component, a timer with visual and sound feedback and on the other side it has a small remote with haptic feedback. You can also set checkpoints, when you want to be reminded how much time you have left. 

When giving our feedback we mostly had questions to the other team and ideas of what should also be considered. For example does the timer stop making a noise when the remote is placed back into the station on top of the main component or only if the stop button is pressed? What is the remote for? Could it maybe also be a laser pointer? Is there also a start and stop button on the remote? How is the checkpoint set? Can there be more than one checkpoint? Is there a visual feedback once the checkpoint is set? How can you add more time to the timer once it is already running? Is it possible to set more than 1h because that corresponds to one turn of the pointer to set the time. Maybe it is smart to lable the inner circle with 15,30 and 45 minuites to indicate the time intervals. 



## Progress Report

_Update your concept/storyboard according to the feedback you received after your presentation and in the peer evaluation (you will need these illustrations again when you present your final project, so it’s worth the effort). Make sure you briefly report on these changes (in words/pictures)._

### What we achieved this week

We presented our concept to the class, got and gave feedback and then worked on improving our paper prototype and implemented the given feedback. We added something to change the angle of the tablet and renamed the three buttons.

### What we could not achieve this week

nothing

### What we plan to do for the coming week

Order the components and maybe already 3D print some parts for the next protoype.

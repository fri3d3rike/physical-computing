# PhysComp SS23 Group 09 - Week 02

## Progress Report

### What we achieved this week

In class, we learned about sketching and prototypes. Later, we completed the electronics and programming lessons from part 1 of the CTC GO! course. This includes basic battery-powered circuits for driving an LED with resistors and switches. We also programmed the Arduino microcontroller to blink two LEDs at the same time. We than modified the code to make the LEDs blink alternatingly.

We were given the topic _Telepresence System_.

Afterwards, we went through the chapters 1-3 from the Physical Computing Website by NYU as well as the CTC GO! course material.
